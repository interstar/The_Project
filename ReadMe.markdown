Hi!  Welcome to _The Project_, which is what a few of us are calling the sum of the enlightened technology projects and next edge systems orbiting in our spheres. It is very early days in this repo! Come take a look and cocreate with us.

Note that Github is designed for coders! Which is why we have a how-to on "[Collaborating Like a Hacker](The_Project/blob/master/Collaborating-Like-a-Hacker.markdown)", to train our communities in using this powerful technology, which powers much of the modern open source software movement. 

For more inspiration and context, check out Harlan's post [Collaboratory Now](http://www.harlantwood.net/pub/Collaboratory_Now/index.html), and also [Clay Shirky's TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html) on "how democracies can take a lesson from the Internet, to be not just transparent but also to draw on the knowledge of all their citizens."
